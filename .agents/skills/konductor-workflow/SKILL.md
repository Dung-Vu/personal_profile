# Konductor Workflow

Use this skill for repo-local Konductor setup, refresh, and history review.

## Core Rules

- Read `KONDUCTOR.md` first.
- Keep outputs compact and repo-specific.
- Treat `docs/CHECK_IN.md` as short-term working state that `/k-checkin` refreshes and `/k-compact` compresses.
- Treat `.konductor/memory/KONDUCTOR_MEMORY.md` and `.konductor/memory/KONDUCTOR_ADR_HISTORY.md` as durable memory.
- Treat `.konductor/memory/KONDUCTOR_VISION_ROADMAP.md` as durable intent.
- Use `npx konductor-workflow@latest hello` only for intro/help text.

## /k-init

1. Read `KONDUCTOR.md`, `docs/KONDUCTOR_GUIDE.md`, `docs/PROJECT_SKILLS_WORKFLOW.md`, `docs/CHECK_IN.md`, `.konductor/memory/KONDUCTOR_VISION_ROADMAP.md`, `.konductor/memory/KONDUCTOR_MEMORY.md`, and `.konductor/memory/KONDUCTOR_ADR_HISTORY.md`.
2. Summarize the repository state, active goals, current work, and highest-risk tech debt.
3. Keep output short, specific, and decision-oriented.

## /k-update

1. Run `npx konductor-workflow@latest` from the repository root.
2. Confirm the installed runtime skill is written to `.agents/skills/konductor-workflow/SKILL.md`.
3. If the user only wants intro text, run `npx konductor-workflow@latest hello`.
4. Report changed files and any follow-up still needed.

## /k-compact

1. Read `KONDUCTOR.md`, `docs/CHECK_IN.md`, `docs/PROJECT_SKILLS_WORKFLOW.md`, `.konductor/memory/KONDUCTOR_MEMORY.md`, `.konductor/memory/KONDUCTOR_ADR_HISTORY.md`, and `.konductor/memory/KONDUCTOR_VISION_ROADMAP.md`.
2. Classify every check-in item as active, blocked, completed, stale, or durable.
3. Prune completed items from `docs/CHECK_IN.md` before anything else. Move any durable facts from those items into the appropriate memory or ADR file, then delete the completed check-in entries from the live file.
4. Retain only active or blocked work in `docs/CHECK_IN.md`; drop stale notes that no longer change the next action.
5. Return the smallest useful status summary: current goal, remaining blockers, and next action.

## /k-checkin

1. Read `KONDUCTOR.md`, `docs/CHECK_IN.md`, and the three durable memory files.
2. Classify each live-state item as active, blocked, completed, stale, or durable.
3. Prune completed items from `docs/CHECK_IN.md` before rewriting the live file. Move any durable facts into the appropriate memory or ADR file, then drop stale notes that no longer affect the next step.
4. Refresh `docs/CHECK_IN.md` with only the current status, active goals, blockers, and handoff point.
5. Return a compact check-in summary for the human.

## /k-history

1. Read `.konductor/memory/KONDUCTOR_MEMORY.md`, `.konductor/memory/KONDUCTOR_ADR_HISTORY.md`, `.konductor/memory/KONDUCTOR_VISION_ROADMAP.md`, and `docs/CHECK_IN.md`.
2. Summarize durable rules, architectural decisions, roadmap intent, and live WIP.
3. Call out gaps, conflicts, or missing memory explicitly.

## Repo Map

- `KONDUCTOR.md`: compact repository contract and read-first alignment file.
- `SKILL.md`: universal Konductor skill source and trigger map.
- `.agents/skills/konductor-workflow/SKILL.md`: installed runtime copy of the skill.
- `docs/PROJECT_SKILLS_WORKFLOW.md`: human-facing slash-command catalog.
- `docs/KONDUCTOR_GUIDE.md`: daily-use guide for adopters.
- `docs/CHECK_IN.md`: live working state; keep compact, and refresh with `/k-checkin`.
- `.konductor/memory/KONDUCTOR_MEMORY.md`: durable conventions and shared knowledge.
- `.konductor/memory/KONDUCTOR_ADR_HISTORY.md`: durable architectural decisions.
- `.konductor/memory/KONDUCTOR_VISION_ROADMAP.md`: durable intent and roadmap.
